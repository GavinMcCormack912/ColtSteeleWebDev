    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <p>Unlike other cephalopods, cuttlefish possess a unique internal 
        structure called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuttlebone">cuttlebone</a>, a highly modified internal 
        shell, which is porous and is made of aragonite. Except for 
        spirula, they are the only coleoid cephalopods with a shell 
        with a phragmocone divided into chambers separated by septa.[13] 
        The pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates 
        by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered cuttlebone 
        via the ventral siphuncle.[14] Each species' cuttlebone has a 
        distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture. The 
        cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features 
        that distinguish them from their squid relatives.[15]
